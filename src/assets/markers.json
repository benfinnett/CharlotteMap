As the train pulls away from the station the conductor will whistle and the train horn will sound. The train sets off smoothly and there is a lot of chugging and creaking noises. There is a smell of fuel throughout the journey. It can be quite bumpy but it is a delightful way to view the whole museum. There are two stops along the way and the conductor will share some more information at the Brockham stop. It might be quite an abrupt departure from Brockham station as the train makes its way to the final stop. Overall the journey can be quite clunky and rattly. The journey can take any time between 5-10 mins.",
